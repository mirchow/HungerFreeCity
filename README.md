# Hunger Free City

Hunger Free City provides easy communication channel for People to understand what needs Food Banks in their area have. Food Banks list top needed items, so that users, when they are shopping for donations items, can understand what the real needs really are.

This forked repo is an alternative implementation implemented using freely accessible software. 
Node.js + Mongodb server, iOS Swift, Android for application
