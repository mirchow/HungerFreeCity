# Hunger Free City
Connecting people to the needs of Community.

Hunger Free City provides easy way to find out what the needs of your local community are. Food Banks list top needed items, so that users, when they are shopping for donations items, can understand what the real needs are.

This forked repo is an alternative implementation implemented using freely accessible software using
Node.js + Mongodb server, iOS Swift, Android.
